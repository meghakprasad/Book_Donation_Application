Book Donation Application:

The Book Donation Management Android App is a user-centric application designed to facilitate the process of book donation and request. This application provides a platform for users to donate their books, including textbooks, written or printed notes, and enables other users to request these donated books. By leveraging the power of Android Studio and the ease of use of an emulator, users can conveniently access and utilize the app's features.

The primary goal of the app is to connect book donors with individuals in need of books, creating a mutually beneficial environment that promotes knowledge sharing and resource utilization. The app's user module plays a crucial role in enabling users to participate in the book donation process seamlessly.
